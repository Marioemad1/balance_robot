# balance_robot
Self-Balancing Robot using Arduino + MPU6050 This project is a self-balancing robot powered by an Arduino Nano, using feedback from the MPU6050 gyroscope and accelerometer sensor. It reads tilt angle in real-time and adjusts the direction and speed of two DC motors to maintain balance.
